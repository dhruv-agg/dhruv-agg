# 👋 Hi, I'm Dhruv Aggarwal

### 💼 Lead LLMOps/MLOps Engineer | 8+ Years Experience | Production AI Systems

I'm a Lead LLMOps/MLOps Engineer with 8+ years of experience designing, deploying, and scaling machine learning and Generative AI systems that perform in production. My expertise lies at the intersection of **MLOps, LLMOps, and data engineering**, where I enable fast experimentation, robust deployment, and reliable operations of LLMs and predictive models at scale.

I've led the development of high-throughput data pipelines supporting both batch and real-time inference, using tools like **PySpark, Python, Docker, and Kubernetes**. In the world of LLMOps, reliability and governance are paramount — I've implemented strong monitoring, observability, and FinOps practices to ensure our systems are cost-effective and trustworthy across both **AWS Cloud and Microsoft Azure** infrastructures.
